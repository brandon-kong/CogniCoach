## Inspiration
As the population ages, the impact of Alzheimer's and dementia is becoming increasingly prevalent. Managing memory impairments can be overwhelming for both patients and caregivers, leading to a need for innovative solutions. Inspired by the belief that technology can be a game-changer in memory care, our team has developed an AI-powered personal assistant that is specifically designed to support individuals with Alzheimer's and dementia. CogniCoach combines cutting-edge features to provide comprehensive support for patients and caregivers, while also offering valuable day-to-day insights to doctors and researchers.

## What it does
Imagine a cutting-edge AI-powered personal assistant, and educational platfom that is specifically designed to provide memory support for individuals with Alzheimer's and dementia, along with their caregivers. Introducing our revolutionary app that combines advanced technology with compassionate care to transform the lives of those affected by memory-related conditions. With our app, caregivers gain access to a comprehensive dashboard that provides crucial health statistics and real-time location tracking of their patients. This empowers caregivers with the information they need to ensure the safety and well-being of their loved ones, especially in case of emergencies. Patients, on the other hand, can input their typical schedule into the app and easily share it with their caregivers. This allows caregivers to have a holistic view of the patient's daily routine, helping them provide better care and support. One of the standout features of our app is the memory improvement games that are tailored to the individual's cognitive abilities and preferences. These games are powered by AI and provide engaging and interactive gameplay that challenges the brain and helps improve memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. Caregivers can track the patient's progress over time and gain insights into their cognitive improvement, enabling them to better understand the impact of the care plan and make informed decisions. Furthermore, our app includes a unique AI facial recognition feature that allows patients to identify their loved ones using the camera on their device. This feature brings familiarity and emotional connection to patients, helping them feel more connected to their family and friends. Our AI-powered personal assistant for memory support is a game-changer in the field of Alzheimer's and dementia care, providing caregivers with essential tools for monitoring and caregiving, and empowering patients to enhance their cognitive function and maintain meaningful connections. Join us in revolutionizing memory support and making a positive impact in the lives of individuals with Alzheimer's and dementia and their caregivers.

## How we built it
Our AI-powered personal assistant for memory support is built on a sophisticated technology stack that includes React Native for the front-end, PostgreSQL for the database, Django for the back-end server, and Django REST Framework for building RESTful APIs. Additionally, we utilize React Native Face Detection for facial recognition, Maps API for geolocation, and React Native SVG Charts for advanced data visualization. This intricate and robust tech stack enables us to seamlessly integrate various functionalities and data sources, creating a highly sophisticated and technologically advanced solution for individuals with Alzheimer's and dementia.

## Challenges we ran into
There were many challenges we ran into, including but (very) not limited to: 1. Using APIs we do not have much experience with 2. Hard to implement Tensorflow machine learning algorithm to detect, with the given technologies (React Native) on a mobile device 3. Initial scope was too large, but we scaled it down to a product that was more reasonable, but fulfilled the criteria.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We take immense pride in successfully implementing state-of-the-art mobile AI face detection capabilities within our app, enabling it to accurately identify and recognize the faces of the patients' relatives. This cutting-edge technology required intricate algorithms and sophisticated image processing techniques to ensure precise facial recognition, making it a technically complex and advanced feature that sets our app apart. Additionally, our team worked diligently to incorporate a multitude of features within the allotted time frame, showcasing our technical prowess in seamlessly integrating various functionalities such as scheduling, data visualization, and user authentication. Our user interface (UI) was thoughtfully designed with a minimalist approach, taking into consideration the unique needs and preferences of our target audience, which further demonstrates our attention to detail and technical expertise in creating an intuitive and user-friendly app interface.

## What we learned
We learned a lot of new technologies. For example, a member of our team had never done front end before, and she learned how to use React Native. The facial detection API was also very new to us, since it did not have as much documentation as we would have liked, but still managed to figure out how it worked. Our team also learned how to use Django for the first time.

## What's next
We want to ideally host our app on the App Store, and add voice commands/assistance (i.e. add more features to make it even more accessible for patients with Alzheimer's/dementia).
